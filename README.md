# Flower Hotel (Tourism Website)
# 1 Project Description
 The theme that we have agreed upon for this project is Tourism. For this particular 
project, our group has decided to start a hotel business as Malaysia is one of the countries that 
have a lot of interesting places that tourists can go for a visit. With this initiative, it will come 
in a lot of handy if we open up a new start-up business in the tourism area. The Flower Hotel 
is an organization that aims to provide everything that the customers wish during their stay in 
this hotel as our motto is “guest happiness is our priority”. With that said, we intend to give 
our all service the best that we can for our beloved guests.

Our website consists of seven main pages which are welcome, home, attraction, 
booking, room, about us, and contact. We have chosen Noto Serif as our main font for this 
website project. The whole concept for our website is minimalist yet eye-catchy and bold 
with the dark shade of brown as our main color. Apart from that, the button is easy to 
navigate and very straightforward for the guest to have more information or book a room in 
Flower Hotel. The elements used come up with multi-color choices according to our needs 
also based on suitability.

For the organization body, we have our own steps and terms in managing our team 
and organization. First and foremost, we manage our system by putting the welcome page as 
symbolic to welcome our guests wholeheartedly in spending the night in our hotel and 
trusting us with the service that we can provide during their stay in the hotel. Following 
through, the guest can navigate their way through the website according to their preferences. 

For instance, if the guest feels the need to survey for a room, they can do so by clicking on 
the button room or if they want to stay the night, they can go to the booking button. There are 
so many options for the guest we prepare according to their needs and satisfaction. For the 
page contact, guests can reach us out based on the address and location given and social 
media listed on that page. Guests also can follow our social media to get the latest 
information and promotion for our hotel. It also gives priority to our regular check-in and 
having good accommodation in our hotel.

Our end goal for this website creation is that we can reach out to as many guests as we 
can about the Flower Hotel. In addition to that, we are hoping that we can level up to the 
guest’s satisfaction and contentment. By doing so, the guest will not hesitate to stay and have 
us at their service anytime.
